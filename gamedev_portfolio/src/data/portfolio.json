Mainly I worked as a gameplay and tools programmer, tackling the more combat-oriented aspects of the game. I implemented the player controller, together with an aim assist system, as well as the functionality and toolset used to create all the abilities used both by the main player and the enemies."

In this project I had to deal with the nuances of capturing both mouse and keyboard input, handling collisions, keeping track of my own deltaTime to handle the simulation and even developing custom shaders for specific components.

I've been developing different kinds of user-oriented software since 2016, when I stumbled upon coding tutorials and Unity (which back then seemed like absolute black magic). Currently, as a part of my master's degree, I'm working on Shuvani, a completely original title. \nI've always been a very curious and creative individual which is why I was quickly drawn towards the more artistic fields of computer engineering, ultimately ending up in the video game industry. Honestly, I should've seen it coming.",
